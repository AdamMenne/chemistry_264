  abstract = {Abstract             Acclimation of the waterflea Daphnia magna Straus (Crustacea: Cladocera) at 2 o to 12 o C above their habitat temperature (16 o C) for 6 months increased the rate of their metabolic activity (respiration and heartbeat rates). Temperature-enhanced activity appeared to be supported by cellular ATP synthesis (increased cytochrome c oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase activities) and hydrolysis (increased ATPases activities), indicating high rate of intermediary metabolism, the substrates for which may come from the stored glycogen and fat in addition to ingested food. Temperature-enhanced activity was associated with loss of body mass and decrease in body size, both of which may result from hyperactivity (causing lack of replenishment of consumed stored glycogen and fat) and loss of body water (due to hyperosmolarity of water because of evaporation). Hyperthermia-caused hypoxia was associated with increase in hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis (a typical daphnid response to hypoxia). These responses to hyperthermic stress started showing up after one month of acclimation at 27 o-29 o C and after 6 months at lower temperature ranges (18 o-20 o C) indicating the possibility of initiation of similar responses in field populations at current expected rise in global temperature due to climate change. Since the thermal stress will continue for generations, the effects observed with D. magna may start showing up in other small aquatic poikilotherms; indicating the speeding up of their life processes and of their gametes, embryos, larvae, and young adults. Such responses can affect aquatic ecosystem dynamics.},

  abstract = {Water fleas are a good model for ecotoxicity studies, and were proposed for this purpose by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, due to their easy culture, body transparency, and high sensitivity to chemical pollution. Cardiovascular function parameters are usually used as an indicator of toxicity evaluation. However, due to the nature of the heart and blood flow, and the speed of the heartbeat, it is difficult to perform precise heartbeat and blood flow measurements with a low level of bias. In addition, the other cardiovascular parameters, including stroke volume, cardiac output, fractional shortening, and ejection fraction, have seldom been carefully addressed in previous studies. In this paper, high-speed videography and ImageJ-based methods were adopted to analyze cardiovascular function in water fleas. The heartbeat and blood flow for three water flea species, Daphnia magna, Daphnia silimis, and Moina sp., were captured by high-speed videography and analyzed using open-source ImageJ software. We found the heartbeat is species-dependent but not size-dependent in water fleas. Among the three water fleas tested, D. magna was identified as having the most robust heartbeat and blood flow rate, and is therefore suitable for the ecotoxicity test. Moreover, by calculating the diameter of the heart, we succeeded in measuring other cardiovascular parameters. D. magna were challenged with temperature changes and a pesticide (imidacloprid) to analyze variations in its cardiovascular function. We found that the heartbeat of D. magna was temperature-dependent, since the heartbeat was increasing with temperature. A similar result was shown in the cardiac output parameter. We also observed that the heartbeat, cardiac output, and heartbeat regularity are significantly reduced when exposed to imidacloprid at a low dose of 1 ppb (parts per billion). The blood flow rate, stroke volume, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening, on the contrary, did not display significant changes. In conclusion, in this study, we report a simple, highly accurate, and cost-effective method to perform physiological and toxicological assessments in water fleas.},

While thermal effects in ecologically important groups such as daphnids have been intensively studied at the ecosystem level and at least partly at the organismic level, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the acclimation to different temperatures. By using 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, the present study identified the major elements of the temperature-induced subset of the proteome from differently acclimated                 Daphnia pulex                 .                                                        Results                                Specific sets of proteins were found to be differentially expressed in 10°C or 20°C acclimated                 D. pulex                 . Most cold-repressed proteins comprised secretory enzymes which are involved in protein digestion (trypsins, chymotrypsins, astacin, carboxypeptidases). The cold-induced sets of proteins included several vitellogenin and actin isoforms (cytoplasmic and muscle-specific), and an AAA+ ATPase. Carbohydrate-modifying enzymes were constitutively expressed or down-regulated in the cold.                                                        Conclusion                                Specific sets of cold-repressed and cold-induced proteins in                 D. pulex                 can be related to changes in the cellular demand for amino acids or to the compensatory control of physiological processes. The increase of proteolytic enzyme concentration and the decrease of vitellogenin, actin and total protein concentration between 10°C and 20°C acclimated animals reflect the increased amino-acids demand and the reduced protein reserves in the animal's body. Conversely, the increase of actin concentration in cold-acclimated animals may contribute to a compensatory mechanism which ensures the relative constancy of muscular performance. The sheer number of peptidase genes (serine-peptidase-like: {$>$} 200, astacin-like: 36, carboxypeptidase-like: 30) in the                 D. pulex                 genome suggests large-scaled gene family expansions that might reflect specific adaptations to the lifestyle of a planktonic filter feeder in a highly variable aquatic environment.},
